# Dart Store - Command Line Version

A mock-up of a [POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale) system written in dart with a command line UI. The goal is to use the same class structure to create a UI in flutter for a store. When that project is complete, the repository will be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

All of this is in preparation for a 4 player chess timer developed in flutter, the code for which can be found [here](https://github.com/Quiggleson/4Chess).

## Usage

If you wish to spend all of your money at the Dart Store:
1. Install Dart on your machine, either via the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) or through [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4s-kBhDqARIsAN-ipH2vWcOVR5ZOrLKnFQ4tvj7MkxB_05QVN0GCebg4uGFl4K-wLJMHaiYaApPpEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
2. Clone the repository via git, or download the code.
3. Navigate to the directory in the command line and run ```dart dartstore.dart```.

Happy spending!
