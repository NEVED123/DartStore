# Dart Store - Command Line Version

A mock-up of a [POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale) system written in dart with a command line UI. The goal is to use the same class structure to create a UI in flutter for a store. When that project is complete, the repository will be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

All of this is in preparation for a 4 player chess timer developed in flutter, the code for which can be found [here](https://github.com/Quiggleson/4Chess).
